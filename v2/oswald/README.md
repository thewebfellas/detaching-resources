# Oswald

Oswald aims to ease the implementation of services-oriented systems
providing a simple way for ruby objects to exchange messages
(publish/consume) using RabbitMQ.

# Is it any good?

Eh, well, it served for its purposes. Eventually it will be good one
day.

# Is it "Production Readyâ„¢"?

HELL NO! Oswald is just a proof of concept. If you need something to use
in production, I suggest seeing [Hutch](https://github.com/gocardless/hutch), which Oswald
was somewhat inspired by.
